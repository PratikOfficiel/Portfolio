    profession: 'Software Developer',
    institute: 'Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi',
    about: `I'm a tech enthusiast who graduated from IIT BHU in Engineering Physics and has spent 7 months working in the industry. During college, I got my hands dirty with everything from building websites to quantum computing, working with tools like Python, MERN stack, and C++. These days, I'm really into system design and building clean, efficient code â€“ you know, the kind that makes other developers smile. I'm a quick learner who loves solving real problems, not just theoretical ones. Looking to join a team where I can put my skills to work on exciting challenges and make something that matters.`
